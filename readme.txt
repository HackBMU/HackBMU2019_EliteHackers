Our team is creating an application which is useful for the security personals and can be easily employed in the PCR van. 
They can detect and monitor various activities like:-
1.) Face recognition
2.) Motion detection
3.) Unfamiliar gatherings(mob lynching,stampede)

Advantages for the user
1.) Face Recognition - Security personals can easily detect and find the person they are looking for.
2.) Motion Detection - Motion detection is useful to detect the traffic in particular area.
3.) Unfamiliar gathering - The unfamiliar gathering detection could be challenging task to implement on the machine learning because it can
    produce the false result. So we came up with the idea that in any unfamiliar gatherings the crowd suddenly gets dispersed away from 
    the gathering. Many people will run here and there are there would be a lot of chaos. So we can easily detect this dispersing crowd 
    using the machine learning.

	And apart from these we are thinking to implement and define the path which the drone will traverse in order to monitor the streets
	and collect and send the data to the particular centralized server.
	
Technologies we are building our project with :
# opencv
# Machine learning 
# Platform is yet to be decided and it is totally dependent over the association of the ml and opencv modules with the platform itself.
